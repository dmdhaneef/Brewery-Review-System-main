Step 3: In XAMPP folder find htdocs folder. Copy and paste the extracted zip folder into htdocs holder.

Step 4: Open XAMPP Control Panel. Start the Apache and MYSQL modules. After starting the MYSQL module click on Admin. This takes us to phpMyAdmin.

Step 5: Click on new and create a new Database. In our case database name is "reviews_db".

Step 6: Once Database is created successfully, click on import. Import the database which resides in SQL folder of the downloaded source code.
